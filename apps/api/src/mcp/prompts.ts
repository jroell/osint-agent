 *   - Each prompt names SPECIFIC tools so the agent picks the right primitive
 *   - Each prompt sequences calls in dependency order (resolve before enrich)

`Run a full domain-recon investigation on **${target}**. Execute these phases in order, summarizing findings between phases:

**Phase 1 — Footprint** (parallel):
- \`whois_lookup\` for registration history
- \`dns_lookup\` for the canonical DNS view
- \`cert_transparency\` for the historical SAN list (often surfaces forgotten subdomains)
- \`subfinder_enum\` for active-source subdomain enumeration

**Phase 2 — Asset enrichment** (parallel, on the subdomains found in Phase 1):
- \`http_probe\` to find live HTTP services
- \`tech_stack\` (Wappalyzer-style) for software fingerprints
- \`shodan_internetdb\` on each resolved IP for ports/CPEs/CVEs (free, no key)
- \`favicon_pivot\` for cross-platform infrastructure correlation

**Phase 3 — Exposed surface** (parallel):
- \`exposed_assets\` for misconfigured S3/GCS/Azure blobs
- \`git_secrets\` for leaked GitHub creds
- \`takeover_check\` for dangling subdomain takeovers

**Phase 4 — API surface discovery** (the moat — these all auto-feed \`api_endpoint_record\`):
- \`js_endpoint_extract\` — extract API URLs from JS bundles (LinkFinder-class)
- \`swagger_openapi_finder\` — probe ~35 well-known spec paths
- \`graphql_introspection\` (try first) → \`graphql_clairvoyance\` (fallback when locked)
- \`wayback_endpoint_extract\` — historical archive may expose forgotten endpoints
- \`alienvault_otx_passive_dns\` — passive DNS shadow (4th moat channel; needs OTX_API_KEY)

**Phase 5 — Operator binding** (the SOTA "connect-the-dots" step):
- \`tracker_extract\` on the homepage and 2-3 key subdomains
- Strong tracker IDs (GA UA-/G-, GTM-, FB pixel) = same-operator fingerprint
- Use these IDs to pivot via \`urlscan_search\` for sister sites

**Phase 6 — Synthesis**:
- Query the moat: \`api_endpoint_lookup\` to see what we know cumulatively
- Summarize: who owns it (registrant + tracker IDs), what's running (CPE summary), what's exposed (CVEs + leaks), how many endpoints catalogued, lateral pivots discovered.

**Phase 2 — Email-specific** (if input is an email):
- \`hibp_check\` — Have I Been Pwned breach correlation
- \`gravatar_lookup\` — public profile metadata
- \`hunter_io_verify\` — email validity + company linkage

**Phase 3 — Federated/social discovery** (parallel):
- \`mastodon_search\`, \`bluesky_search\`, \`keybase_lookup\` — federated identity (5-instance fallback baked into mastodon)
- \`hackernews_user\`, \`stackexchange_user\`, \`reddit_user\` — long-tail tech presence
- \`github_user\`, \`github_emails\` — coding identity + commit-leaked emails

**Phase 4 — Synthesis**:
- \`person_aggregate\` — meta-tool that fans out across the above and unifies results

- \`shodan_internetdb\` on the resolved IPs for honeypot tags / known-bad CPEs

**Phase 4 — Pivot for adjacent infrastructure**:

- For every distinct A record across all subdomains, run \`asn_lookup\`

- For each unique IP: \`shodan_internetdb\` (free port/CPE/CVE fingerprint)

- \`favicon_pivot\` on each — same favicon hash across all = same internal team

- \`shodan_internetdb\` on overlapping IPs to confirm

**Channel 4 — Breach co-occurrence** (if entities are people/emails):
